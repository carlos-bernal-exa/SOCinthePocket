**Entities Extracted by AI:** 4

1. **ip:** `192.168.1.100` (confidence: 0.95)
2. **email:** `admin@company.com` (confidence: 0.95)
3. **username:** `admin` (confidence: 0.95)
4. **file_hash:** `5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592` (confidence: 0.95)

**AI-Generated Hypotheses:** 4

1. **External Brute-Force with Malware Delivery:** An external attacker is attempting to brute-force the admin account, and simultaneously, a malicious file (possibly a dropper, backdoor, or credential stealer) has been introduced into the environment, potentially via another vector or as part of the same attack chain.
2. **Internal Compromise and Lateral Movement:** An internal system (192.168.1.100) is already compromised and is attempting to gain elevated privileges by brute-forcing the admin account, possibly to facilitate lateral movement, privilege escalation, or further malicious activity. The malicious file hash could be related to the initial compromise or a tool being deployed.
3. **Insider Threat:** A malicious insider is attempting to gain unauthorized access to the admin account and has introduced a malicious file to aid in their objectives or establish persistence.
4. **Misconfigured Application/Service Account:** A misconfigured application or service account on 192.168.1.100 is repeatedly attempting to authenticate as 'admin', causing the failed login alerts. The malicious file hash, in this less likely scenario, would be an unrelated detection on the same host.
