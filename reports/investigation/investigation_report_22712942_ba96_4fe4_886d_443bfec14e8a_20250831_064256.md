**AI-Generated Hypotheses:** 4

1. **Hypothesis 1 (Successful Credential Compromise):** Andrew clicked the phishing link, landed on the malicious page, and submitted corporate credentials, leading to account takeover.
2. **Hypothesis 2 (Unsuccessful Phishing - User Aware):** Andrew clicked the link but recognized it as phishing before submitting any credentials, closing the page immediately. The communication was logged but no compromise occurred.
3. **Hypothesis 3 (Unsuccessful Phishing - Technical Block):** The communication was attempted but blocked by a security control (e.g., web filter, proxy) before the user could fully interact or submit credentials.
4. **Hypothesis 4 (Automated Access/Malware):** Malware on Andrew's workstation initiated the communication to the phishing domain, potentially as part of a command-and-control (C2) or data exfiltration attempt, rather than direct user interaction.
