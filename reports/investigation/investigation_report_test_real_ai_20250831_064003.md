**Entities Extracted by AI:** 5

1. **ip:** `192.168.1.100` (confidence: 0.95)
2. **email:** `admin@company.com` (confidence: 0.95)
3. **file_hash:** `5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592` (confidence: 0.95)
4. **username:** `admin` (confidence: 0.95)
5. **domain:** `company.com` (confidence: 0.8)

**AI-Generated Hypotheses:** 4

1. **Compromised Internal Host**: An internal system (192.168.1.100) has been compromised by malware or an attacker, and is now being used to brute force the 'admin' account to gain elevated privileges or lateral movement. The malicious file hash is likely related to the compromise or the attack tool.
2. **Insider Threat**: An internal user, potentially from the device at 192.168.1.100, is attempting to gain unauthorized access to the 'admin' account. The malicious file hash could be a tool they are using.
3. **Malware Activity**: Malware on the system at 192.168.1.100 is attempting to spread or escalate privileges by brute-forcing the 'admin' account, with the associated file hash being part of the malware itself.
4. **Misconfigured Application/Service**: (Less likely given the malicious file hash) A legitimate application or service on 192.168.1.100 is misconfigured and repeatedly attempting to log in with incorrect credentials to the 'admin' account, generating the failed login attempts. However, the malicious file hash would still need to be investigated separately.
