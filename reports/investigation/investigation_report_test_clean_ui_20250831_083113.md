**Entities Extracted by AI:** 4

1. **ip:** `192.168.1.100` (confidence: 0.9)
2. **email:** `admin@company.com` (confidence: 0.9)
3. **file_hash:** `5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592` (confidence: 0.9)
4. **user:** `admin` (confidence: 0.9)

**AI-Generated Hypotheses:** 3

1. **Internal Host Compromise**: An internal system (192.168.1.100) is compromised by malware or an attacker, and is being used to brute force the admin account for privilege escalation or lateral movement. The malicious file hash is likely related to the compromise of this host or a subsequent attack phase.
2. **Insider Threat**: An internal user is attempting to gain unauthorized access to the 'admin' account from a workstation or server (192.168.1.100). The malicious file hash might be a tool they are using or an unrelated finding.
3. **Misconfigured Application/Service**: A legitimate internal application or service on 192.168.1.100 is misconfigured and repeatedly attempting to authenticate with incorrect 'admin' credentials, triggering the brute force alert. The malicious file hash, in this case, might be a false positive or an unrelated, pre-existing issue on the host.
