**AI-Generated Hypotheses:** 4

1. Hypothesis 1: Andrew.balestrieri clicked a phishing link and potentially entered corporate credentials, leading to a credential compromise.
2. Hypothesis 2: Andrew.balestrieri clicked a phishing link, but realized it was malicious before entering any credentials or downloading malware.
3. Hypothesis 3: Andrew.balestrieri's workstation is already compromised (e.g., by malware) and is attempting to communicate with a command-and-control (C2) server disguised as a phishing domain.
4. Hypothesis 4: The alert is a false positive, and the domain is miscategorized, or the user accessed it for a legitimate, non-malicious reason (less likely given 'known phishing domain').
