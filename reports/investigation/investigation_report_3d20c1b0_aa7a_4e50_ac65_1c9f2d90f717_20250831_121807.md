## ü§ñ AI Analysis Results

### üè∑Ô∏è Triage Analysis

- **Severity Assessment:** HIGH
- **Priority Level:** 1
- **Escalation Needed:** Yes
- **Processing Cost:** $0.001391

**Entities Extracted by AI:** 3

1. **hostname:** `wm1ckms01.schq.secious.com` (confidence: 0.95)
2. **ip:** `10.111.64.156` (confidence: 0.9)
3. **ip:** `172.178.160.19` (confidence: 0.95)

**AI-Generated Hypotheses:** 4

1. **Malware-driven Data Exfiltration:** The host is infected with sophisticated malware (e.g., a backdoor, infostealer, or custom exfiltration tool) that has been actively collecting and transferring sensitive data to a Command and Control (C2) server at 172.178.160.19.
2. **Insider Threat / Unauthorized Access:** An unauthorized user or insider has gained access to the host and is manually or semi-automatically exfiltrating data, potentially using legitimate tools or custom scripts, which are being flagged as 'unusual process spawns' and 'abnormal outbound data transfer'.
3. **Compromised Service/Application:** A legitimate service or application on the host has been compromised (e.g., via a vulnerability or misconfiguration) and is being leveraged to exfiltrate data. The 'unusual process spawns' could be related to the exploitation or the exfiltration mechanism.
4. **Supply Chain Compromise:** The host is running a legitimate software that has been tampered with or backdoored, leading to the observed malicious activity.
