- **Processing Cost:** $0.001635

**Entities Extracted by AI:** 4

1. **ip:** `10.111.64.156` (confidence: 0.95)
2. **ip:** `172.178.160.19` (confidence: 0.95)
3. **hostname:** `wm1ckms01.schq.secious.com` (confidence: 1.0)
4. **domain:** `schq.secious.com` (confidence: 0.9)

**AI-Generated Hypotheses:** 3

1. **Malware-driven Data Exfiltration**: The host wm1ckms01.schq.secious.com is infected with sophisticated malware (e.g., a trojan, backdoor, or custom exfiltration tool) that has successfully collected and is actively transferring sensitive data to a command-and-control (C2) server or data drop point at 172.178.160.19.
2. **Insider Threat/Unauthorized Data Transfer**: An unauthorized user or process on wm1ckms01.schq.secious.com is intentionally transferring data to an external location, possibly using legitimate tools or a custom script, which is being flagged as abnormal due to volume or destination.
3. **Compromised Service/Application**: A vulnerable service or application on wm1ckms01.schq.secious.com has been exploited, leading to unauthorized access and subsequent data exfiltration. The 'unusual process spawns' could be related to the exploit itself or post-exploitation activities by the attacker.
