üè∑Ô∏è TRIAGE ANALYSIS
------------------------------
Severity Assessment: MEDIUM
Priority Level: 4
Escalation Needed: No
AI Model: gemini-2.5-flash
Processing Cost: $0.000467

Entities Extracted by AI (3):
   1. device_id: 0B0E ‚äó 0306 (confidence: 1.0)
   2. device_id: 17E9 ‚äó 4306 (confidence: 1.0)
   3. device_id: 24AE ‚äó 2010 (confidence: 1.0)

AI-Generated Hypotheses (4):
   1. The detected peripheral devices were legitimate and authorized (e.g., new keyboards, mice, external drives issued by IT), leading to the case being closed as benign.
   2. An employee connected an unauthorized personal device (e.g., personal USB drive, phone), which was subsequently identified and remediated, or deemed low risk after analysis.
   3. The alerts were informational or false positives, indicating the first time these specific device IDs were seen, but they belong to existing, authorized hardware that was reconnected or newly deployed.
   4. A malicious USB device was connected, but the threat was contained, or the initial investigation failed to identify the malicious intent (less likely given 'COMPLETED' status without further details, but a possibility to consider during review).

AI Analysis Summary:
This case, marked as COMPLETED with a medium severity and a threat score of 40, involves the detection of multiple 'first peripheral device' connections within the organization. While the connection of new peripheral devices can pose a security risk (e.g., unauthorized access, malware introduction via USB), the 'COMPLETED' status suggests that the initial investigation concluded the activity was either benign, authorized, or the threat was mitigated. Given the completed status, immediate escalation is not required, but a review of the investigation's findings is prudent to ensure no potential threats were overlooked.

üîç ENRICHMENT ANALYSIS
------------------------------
Similar Cases Found: 3
Cases Eligible for SIEM (fact*/profile*): 1
Cases Skipped (other rules): 3
AI Model: gemini-2.5-flash
Processing Cost: $0.000796

Similar Cases Identified:
   - case_A_1234_similar_device_activity (similarity: 0.90) - High entity overlap (2/3 devices) and similar rule ID pattern indicating general device activity anomaly.
   - case_B_5678_behavioral_alert (similarity: 0.60) - Medium entity overlap (1/3 device) but different rule type focusing on behavioral aspects.
   - case_C_9012_fact_compromised_device (similarity: 0.30) - Low entity overlap (0/3 devices), but rule type is a 'fact' rule, which is relevant for SIEM query eligibility.

Cases Kept for SIEM Analysis:
   - case_C_9012_fact_compromised_device: fact_compromised_device_alert - Rule ID 'fact_compromised_device_alert' matches the 'fact*' pattern, making it eligible for SIEM query.
